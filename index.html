                  <h4 class="work-role">Website Building</h4>
                  <p>This was our first project of out coding class. Here we dived into CSS, HTML, and GitHub as we 
                    built a website for a running company. We began to grasp the basics of how to build a website
                    and developed our techniques and skills to prepare us for further projects.

                  <h4 class="work-role">Fixing Websites</h4>
                  <p>Horiseon was our first weekly challenge. Here we were given a set of HTML and CSS codes and were 
                    tasked with organizing, simplifying, and making the code much more semantic. This involved breaking
                    down and rewriting much of the prior code. We then had to push the website onto GitHub and make it live!

                  <p>Believe it or not, even this website was built by me! Here I built this website from scratch as a way to
                    not only know me better, but to also see my past work and commitment to new things! With this website I used 
                    all of the skills I have gathered so far and used my best efforts to build a clean website that is capable of
                    showing all of my qualities! With this website I not only built the HTML and CSS from scratch, but customized with photos
                    and Flexboxes to make a clean display that works on almost every device. Using skills i will gain in the future, 
                    I will continue to build upon this site and make a streamlined view into the person I am!
